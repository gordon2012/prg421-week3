This program allows for the manipulation of animal objects that each contain the properties of number of legs, arms, and tails; and whether or not they burrow, swim, and fly.

A menu system allows for the users to add an animal, inputing these properties (for the bools, a y or Y indicates true, all others false). It also allows animals to be deleted.

The list of animals is saved in a file called data.ser
